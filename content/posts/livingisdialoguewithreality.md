_This essay is close to my heart. I’m fascinated by language, and I believe that much of our experience of reality can be understood through an analogy to language. With that said, let’s jump in ~_

# Living is dialogue with reality

Consider living as a language-like activity. This is a statement about our relationship to reality, which takes the form of a dialogue, or a dance. Experience is seen as co-creative, arising in the interaction between self and Other, just as language-based interactions are. Thus this relationship is well-modeled by an analogy to language.

Language is a fantastic model to extend to other domains of experience for at least two reasons: first, it features a call-and-resonse dynamic which carries into many realms of inter-action. Second, it’s intuitively familiar to all of us, thus is accessible as a metaphorical tool1.

Why make this case? Because understanding the languages all around us will bring insight into the nature of skillful living, from macro to the micro and in many domains of life.

To live is to dialogue with reality. How is this so? Let’s start by looking at patterns, once more :)

## We navigate reality by understanding patterns

We navigate experience on the basis of patterns. [Reality is composed of pattern and nonpattern](../patternsareanintrinsicfeatureofreality); what’s useful at our level of magnification are discernible patterns. Regularity signals reliable outcomes, structures, presence of order. If we recognize that B tends to follow from A, we make a connection, and start to learn. This learning is the recognition and understanding of patterns.

We evolved to recognize and learn from patterns. The natural world is full of patterns, and our success as a species depended (still depends) on our ability to effectively parse and respond to these patterns. Suspicious rustling at night? High chance it’s time to get ready for fight or flight. Eating that plant caused you to vomit? Don’t eat it again. Oh, but it’s good if you pound and cook it? A further pattern is learned.

Patterns are the regularities in an otherwise constantly changing world. They transmit information about the structures of the reality around you. The more you understand the structure of your experience, the better you can navigate it.

Successfully navigating that experience depends on your ability to parse the patterns, interpret possible meanings, and respond accordingly. Where else do we do this? With language, all the time. Any time we speak to another, we’re parsing patterns of sound and body language, feeling into meanings, and responding accordingly.

I’m making a case for a broader definition of _language_ that goes something like this: a language is a system of patterns which, when learned well, enables you to effectively navigate some domain of experience.

-   Understanding body language makes for better navigation of social interactions
    
-   Understanding the patterns of various foods makes for better navigation of the world of cooking
    
-   Understanding the signals & meanings that plants send makes you a better gardener
    
-   (_I have no expertise here, but_) I would imagine there’s patterns in markets which, when learned, would make you a more skillful trader
    

Patterns are the component-elements of languages, signals which combine and vary in context, transmitting meanings2. The scent of a coming storm is of the language of weather; animal tracks in mud are of the language of the forest; [flashy colors & funky dance moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XkPeN3AWIE) are of the mating language of bower birds.

## The language of the mountain

I was recently out in Shenandoah National Park, visiting the mountains for a weekend. Hiking down from a peak in the waning sunlight, all of this _language-is-all-around-us_ stuff clicked. As I navigated the craggly terrain along a high ridge, I saw that I was, in a way, dialoguing with the mountain with every step I took.

Each step was an exchange between the mountain & I. _The ground here is packed and grippy_, _good to step on -_ sure, I’ll place my foot there. _This rock is muddier_, _might be slippery_ - “don’t step here”, it says. Stop to read the terrain: a sharp scramble downwards signals caution, and a keen eye sees where the rocks will tumble and where they’ll hold. A darkening sky (and the bear warnings seen earlier) says _hurry down, but watch your step ever more so._

Navigating the trail became a continuous, fluid conversation with the mountain. At each step signals were sent, and making my way along depended on how well I could parse & respond to the those patterns. It was a language-like experience, a call-and-response co-creation, made possible by the mutual inter-action of the mountain & I.

I don’t want to stretch this metaphor too far. _Language_ works well here, but I’m still struck by a key difference between human language and natural languages. Human language is recursive - infinitely remix-able. We can produce endlessly novel combinations of words & phrases & ideas. In contrast, the mountain trail sings roughly the same song each time.

It’s still pattern, still an exchange of signal-to-interpretation-to-response, so I want to call it language, dialogue. But there’s something in this to consider a bit further.

## A spectrum of motion, stable~to~dynamic

In some cases reality is telling a story - the mountain - and in others it’s actively dialoguing with us. The distinction is of _stable_ versus _dynamic_ domains of experience. In other words, there are patterns that tend to move and patterns that generally don’t, and interaction with the two is different.

The mountain trail is relatively static, so the experience it offers remains similar each time. An encounter with a bear, though, would be a much more dynamic experience, with its own exchange of signals & meanings - a different experience each time, demanding skillful navigation of the present situation.

I used to work in an organic garden, where the plants spoke through their own language. The appearance of leaves and stems sent visual signals, telling me if they were drying out or drowning, struggling to root, ready to fruit, and so on. The soil spoke too, indicating where it could use some aeration, where it was over- or under- watered.

This is somewhere between static & dynamic - the garden & I dialogued over time, each day a bit different as the seasons wore on. This calls for accurate interpretation and response to a dynamically unfolding domain of patterns.

But it’s not _that_ dynamic - a zucchini plant isn’t much different from day to day, or year to year. And nature’s patterns - plants, animals, ecosystems - may be dynamic in terms of _motion_, but they evolve very slowly. Dynamic on the micro-level, relatively static on the macro.

In constrast, we humans are incredibly dynamic. Our culture & thought evolves quickly, such that we’re constantly adapting to new patterns. We use a variety of languages - body language, social ettiquette, music, spoken language.

Some are more dynamic than others. Ideas can evolve much more quickly than social structures; body language is not as flexible as word-language. All the same, humans live quite differently today than we did 5,000 years ago, whereas I’d bet bears are doing roughly the same things.

Let’s revise our definition of _language_ to integrate this distinction:

- In some domains, living is like language: co-created inter-action with dynamic realities. We come to understand many of these languages naturally, but others remain unknown to us.

## We can grow fluent in the languages that compose our lives

By modeling living as composed of language-like domains of interplay, we can see how to grow skillful in living.

Languages are skills to learn, domains in which to cultivate fluency. You do so by developing compositionally your understanding of all the patterns that compose the language.

We can then extend this to living at large - if you develop compositional fluency in each of the domains you choose to live your life in, you grow fluent in living.

Fluency is a matter of interpreting and responding to patterns. Consider English - you’re able to read this because you can match the shapes of words to meanings, in context, and grow a picture of what’s being said as each phrase follows from the previous.

Languages also have underlying structural frameworks, rules for how elements of the language can be combined to form permissible derivative patterns. Fluency means understanding both the elements of a language and the ways in which they can be combined.

Fluency is the ability to interpret, accurately draw meaning from, and effectively respond to some instance of pattern, in context, whether simple or complex in form.

We could say that the more you interact with a language, the fuller your internalized model(s) of its patterns grow, and you are thus developing your vocabulary of patterns. This, again, is your repertoire of both the elements of a language, and ways in which they can be combined. 
- To operate in formal settings in English, you need both a more formal vocabulary and understanding of the grammatical structures that are common in that register of speech. 
- To parse some complex philosophical writing, you may need a glossary and time to figure out what the hell is being said.

Back on the mountain, we can say that the hiker is able to rock-scramble so well because they’ve got a well-internalized catalogue of models which accurately and intuitively indicate to them how to interpret and respond to a wide variety of signals in a wide variety of contexts. So fluency arises from that well-developed internal database of patterns recognized. The brain grows circuitry to handle them, and it all weaves together to give you the ability to intuitively navigate that domain.

How do we develop those internal models of a language-domain? Best case scenario is to learn it young. Growing up near a cliffy reservoir dam, I spent a lot of time climbing & jumping around rocky terrain. At least in part this has given me the ability to intuitively navigate similar terrain, extending the models learned young to similar places.

How we can develop fluency once we’re older is another question. It’s what I’m working on, and I’ve got some pretty exciting things developing.

This is a major part of the meaning of *living fluently*. Understand reality as pattern; see that patterns build to languages; grasp that skillful living is the pursuit of fluency in those languages which speak to you.

1: I’m a huge fan of plain language, and keeping barriers to entry accessible. Some standards, but not so much that we’re exclusive on the basis of the privilege of time and energy it takes to acquire a whole new lexicon of complex terminology.

2: Thoughts on context: a big rustling at night might mean an approaching predator; a big rustling in the daytime might mean a deer tripped. Context is important. Patterns are consistent features, which vary in meaning depending on context.
