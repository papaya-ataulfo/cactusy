*Write and refactor this*

## A fluid-mode framework
This is an effort at theorizing and, soon, putting into practice a way of cultivating skill that aims at metasystematicity (I think).

We're composed of/are pattern(s), so designing our-selves in terms of our patterns is a relatively solid idea. Form good habits, and all that. 

Yet much of life isn't/can't be well-navigated with set systems. Much of life calls for us to improvise, to be able to skillfully respond to/navigate experiences which don't map neatly onto the capabilities of any one system/approach/way-of-doing that we've learned.

Language is an area where we're already all pretty good at this. Language is a fluid, recursive, creative, unpredictable phenomenon - yet we can all understand ours, parse input and give well-formed responses.

I'm not totally sure where to go from here. It feels something like "language is like jazz - frameworked, yet improv-permitting. There's some structure, some set-pieces, yet a lot of it is creative, free-form, recursive."

Fluid-mode is for when you can't just make some structured habit-routine for something; instead, you need a fluid web of skill.

### Reasoning
- We navigate reality by parsing and responding to its patterns
	- [Patterns are an intrinsic feature of reality](../patternsareanintrinsicfeatureofreality)
- Prime example of this is language:
	- Incoming linguistic input is parseable to the extent you understand the patterns that compose it
		- If you don't, you can't parse it (fx, you can't really pick out the patterns of a foreign language you don't know)
	- You respond by creating an expression from those patterns - putting together words and phrases in the right relationships

- We can say that:
	- Language is a system of patterns: elements (words, phrases, etc.) and rules for well-formed relationships (grammar)
	- Fluency in language means you have an intuitive/well-conditioned grasp of these patterns: you can easily parse them, and you can create well-formed expressions from them
	- Language is fluid/improv-permitting: it works on improvisational generation of novel expressions created from the language's vocabulary of elements (sounds, words, phrases, etc.) combined according to permissible pattern of relationship (grammar) 

- Generalize a definition of fluency - fluency in some domain is 
	- a) Intuitive/second-nature grasp of that domain's patterns / a deep, wide, well-elaborated internal model of a domain's patterns 
		- i.e. Lexical vocabulary and grammatical vocabulary (what patterns are there, and what sorts of relationships can/do they form ?)
	- Which enables: 
	- b) The ability to fluidly/improvisationally navigate - parse and respond -, thus co-create, in that domain with skillfulness

- The idea is that we can cultivate this sort of fluency in any (?) domain, which would correspond to fluid skillfulness in that domain
	- This feels like what skillfulness at Kegans stage 5 could be
	- Instead of building a skill based on one structure/system, you cultivate a web of skillfulness: a vocabulary of pattern-units from which you can improvisationally create expressions/responses/navigations
	- This makes flexible, context-sensitive responses very possible - instead of referring to any One True Method, you can create new responses appropriate to a given situation
	- David Chapman says this on ethics, emphasis mine:
		- "...Fluidity understands that ethical situations are often inherently nebulous, and in such cases ethical anxiety is unnecessary and unhelpful. It takes ethics to be a matter of collaborative practical improvisation that is responsive to specific situations. Lacking any ultimate principles, *an engineering approach to ethical mastery is impossible, but ethical skill—a toolkit of methods for ethical bricolage—can be learned.**""
		- This is towards the bottom of https://vividness.live/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence
	- We might also do such a thing for memetic mediation, building a web of skills and tools from which to improvise 

- Examples:
	- Rock-scrambling fluency:
		- Thought of this while hiking a rocky mountain: it came to me that there's intuitive, language-like fluency in parsing the terrain of the trail and judging how to navigate it. 
		- It's sort of like dialogue: receive input from the trail ("rocky and wet"), respond ("I'll take it slow")
		- You can hike effectively to the degree that you can parse the trail and respond to it well; someone who has no experience with rocky terrain would struggle more than someone who does
		- Could theoretically chunk down a trail as a "sentence", as granular as you want, and analyze the patterns necessary for effective parsing and responding to the trail
	- Social fluency:
		- Body *language*, etc.
		- A person is socially fluent to the degree they can read a person/a room, follow their patterns, and respond effectively
		- There's consistent things we do with body language signalling, etc.; there's patterns in the ways people meet, do small talk, transition to deeper talk, flirt, and so on
		- If you broke down an instance of social interaction, you could find its patterns and learn from that
		- You could learn social fluency by modeling on the sorts of people who are socially skilled in the ways you'd like to be - learn their patterns and adapt them for yourself
	- We could say you can be fluent in driving
	- Athletic fluency (soccer, basketball etc.)
	- Musical fluency, instrument-specific fluency
- Much of life is made up of these sorts of dynamic, improv-encouraging domains
- The language metaphor can get a bit stretched, but taking this general definition of fluency still gives very useful insights into how we could cultivate fluid skillfulness in various domains

### Practice
- This suggests creating a sort of "language-learning" system, through which to develop fluency in some domain by studying its patterns (elements and rules of relationship)
- Haven't worked this all out in practice yet, below is what I've got:
	- Learn a "language" by studying actual instances of expression
		- Take a sentence, a song, a trail, a yoga routine - break it down into units of pattern, understand how they relate in the present contexts (words, bars, steps, asanas, and the transitions)
			- Learn it as a whole and in terms of it's patterns
		- This yields a bunch of pattern-units (elements and RoR) as well as a set-piece (the song/etc.): pieces of "vocabulary" and a "sentence" to add to your repertoire
		- Add these to a knowledge-web, like in Obsidian/Roam/Athens, etc., develop this as a way to build your vocabulary in this domain (patterns of "words" and "grammar")
		- Use anki to memorize, have a practice of rehearsing your units-of-skill - like you would memorize and practice pronouncing words and sentences.
		- Practice using them yourself, creating new expressions and such - like you would get better at a language by just using it and figuring out how it feels
	- Repeat this process of studying instances of expression, while developing your knowledge-web and practicing, and you'll create an interconnected web of elements, relationships, contexts, as well as set-pieces at various levels of magnification (phrases, sentences; chord progressions, songs; various length yoga pose sequences, etc.)
	- Feel like this would lead towards fluency
