*Big refactor and writing of the component-ideas of this piece*

## Chances are, none of us can really explain it.

Let’s make a bet. If you win, you don’t need to read this. If not, you’ll definitely want to. Here goes:

Name seven behaviors, beliefs, and feelings that you consciously decided to form, for twenty-one total.

You’ve probably habituated a number of intentional behaviors, at least. What about the other two? I’d wager that more have unknown origins than not. And that’s likely true of all of us - rarely do we consciously decide who we are.

So how did we get here, then? In some ways, we’re just along for the ride, and have less control than we’d like to think. There’s a way to change that, though.

Some context: I think of humans as compositions of pattern. That’s the angle I’ll come at this from, too.

Now hold on, because it’s a bit of a windy road ahead.

## You’re made of patterns

You and I live mostly through patterns - habitual pathways of thought, feeling, and action. Experience is shaped by these mostly-automatic ways of interpreting and interacting with the world.

From days to months to years, we’re in our patterns. We’re almost always in the midst of them, whether or not we’re conscious of it. The regularity intrinsic to reality enables us to exist at all, no less navigate such complex lives.

Behaviors mostly operate subconsciously - many things are simply second-nature_,_ like walking, driving, scrolling. This habit-based navigation is energy efficient¹, allowing us to live without conscious attention, which remains free for other tasks, constantly paid to everything.

We also have habitual ways of thinking and feeling. We don’t actively choose thoughts and emotions so much as we react through usual patterns. What do you think of running? How about people who love yoga? How about environmental justice?

Likely your thoughts and feelings are consistent from day to day. They’re patterns, habituated beliefs and emotional responses.

You’re never not interacting with your environment, so you’re near always carrying out some pattern(s). Repetition means reinforcement - patterns are positive feedback loops which grow stronger over time, towards automaticity².

We tend to get set in the patterns we form, hence the annual new-year’s struggle to break old habits and form new ones. Without conscious change, they persist.

Operating as such - on largely unconscious patterns - makes for a reactive relationship with experience. To be consistently mindful isn’t easy to do. The result is often a lack of awareness of the patterns that we form and reinforce.

If we aren’t aware, it’s easy to fall into some pretty nasty habits of thought, feeling, and action. These patterns can really sap your vitality, and if left unchecked, may derail your life.

Now - let’s look at where these patterns come from, and why we tend to have so little control.

## Some (roughly simplified) habit history

So, some background. This isn’t the whole story, but it’s enough for now.

Very simplified, humans evolved to make decisions according to judgments of feeling³. This started with the basic distinction between pleasure and pain, and how they associated with things in our environment.

Many of these associations are inherited, like attraction to sugars and sex, and aversion to lions and spiders. Others, we learn ourselves.

If a choice feels good, we’re more likely to make it. And because pleasure doesn’t last, it motivates repetition of the successful behavior, to regain the reward. In contrast, we’ll tend to avoid making a choice that feels repulsive, and we won’t likely repeat it if we do.

Pleasure and pain are associated with choices that are beneficial or harmful, respectively. Beneficial or harmful to what? At root, it’s about evolution’s goals: this mechanism got humans to make the choices that best led to survival and reproduction.

What about reason, logic? Humans have really come to pride ourselves on our intelligence. But the fact is, anything we reason for is motivated by some underlying feeling⁴.

> _“The point of smarts, from natural selection’s perspective, isn’t to replace feelings but rather to make them better informed… though the calculations that inform our feelings get more and more elaborate, the feelings continue to be what ultimately steer us through life. -Robert Wright, Why Buddhism is True_

Seven hours spent researching new laptops is about finding which one _feels_ best, and all the calculating and comparing of specs is to establish confidence in that feeling.

So - associations of feeling, learned or inherited, set up for evolution’s goals - survival and reproduction - heavily influence our choices. See this for yourself by watching the next few choices you make⁵.

You’re still reading this because you aren’t bored yet. We do _anything_ because it feels good. This makes sense - we wouldn’t be motivated to live if it didn’t feel good.

Back to patterns - repetition of a choice creates a habit, getting you used to it and strengthening the corresponding neural pathways. Feeling thus powerfully influences the patterns we form. 

## A changed environment

This system served us well in the past, but it can’t be said to work as well today. The modern environment is very different, such that feeling-based decisions aren’t the best guides anymore.

Now, it’s stupidly easy to form an abundance of self-destructive patterns. Humans have made highly available the habit-forming sources of pleasure that once indicated something useful - sugary and fatty foods, sex, even social approval.

The digital environment is a hellscape of shallow pleasures. Social media, endless novelty, abundant clickbait and hook-filled noise - it’s easy to form an unhealthy relationship with it all.

> _And just briefly consider the constant flame-wars between left and right - they tear each other down because in-group out-group dynamics create social belonging, which feels (superficially) good. It’s tribal psychology at its worst._

So pleasure isn't a reliable signal anymore. Many modern pleasures can lead into harmful cycles that are difficult to break, as probably all of us know. Ever met someone _without_ any vices?

Mindful awareness is an essential tool for navigating this new terrain. It develops in us the capacity to be non-reactive to sensations, as they arise. You can use mindfulness to sit with a craving for breakfast-cake, and watch that sensation swell, then fade.

Sensation is as temporary as anything else, and will simply pass on if you don’t get tied up in it. Being nonreactive like this is super useful (and freeing). At its core, it enables us to be more conscious of our choices. And in declining to react, we don’t reinforce the pattern.

Mindfulness as a pragmatic tool for managing relationship to feeling is used in therapy, with promising results, and it’s increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for breaking negative patterns⁶.

## Putting it together

So what am I saying, with all of this?

We live in patterns. They mostly operate subconsciously, so we aren’t completely aware of many of ours. They form and reinforce on the basis of feeling-influenced choices, which we also aren’t very mindful of, in an environment full of stimuli stronger and more abundant than we’ve evolved for.

And that, largely, is how our lives unfold!

We run from pain and seek out pleasure in elaborate ways, but only perpetuate the cycle. Throughout life we form patterns from this struggle, and obviously manage to survive. But living through patterns that are oriented towards survival and reproduction doesn’t do much for life beyond those goals.

What’s more, the longer we’re unaware of this underlying dynamic, the longer it shapes our choices, and ultimately our lives.

Why do so many people struggle to exercise? Because it’s unpleasant and no longer necessary for survival.

Why don’t more people eat better? Because they get by _fine_ as-is.

Fine, not well, not joyfully or wonderfully. Fine is enough for survival. The _way we’ve evolved_ is **not optimized** for human happiness, fulfillment, or potential. Those things have little bearing on evolutionary goals.

Being optimized for _fine_ means most of us aren’t very well-aligned with the lives we’d really like to live. That’s a funny thing about humans - we’ve gotten more ambitious than evolution.

Each of us can probably explain how we got to today, but I’d bet none of us know the whole story. Sure, we have some conscious hand in our lives, but how many unmindful, feeling-driven choices have we made? Do we really know where all our habits come from - not just behaviors, but how we think and feel, too?

Our lives are significantly shaped by patterns, but we aren’t taught to understand this, or to consciously manage it.

So here we are, going along with whatever semi-intentional set of habits, beliefs, and feelings we’ve developed. Most of these are inherited, and few are consciously designed or informed by good knowledge.

Do you really know how you got here? I can’t convince myself that that I do.

## Unbeholden to evolution

We’re at an interesting point in the human story, right now.

Among other things, interest in mindful, conscious living is probably at an all time high. More people than ever are choosing to meditate, reading about mindfulness, adapting it for all sorts of contexts and purposes.

And mindfulness is one path to unshackling ourselves from the pleasure-pain hamster wheel. It’s how we can lift ourselves out of self-destructive habits, out of an us-vs-them mindset, out of avoidance of the discomfort that comes from facing up to huge problems.

The Earth is accelerating into environmental disequilibrium, US politics are like bad reality TV, social divisions are worsening, a huge pandemic has deeply shaken our global civilization, and so on. It seems like it’s all getting worse.

Remaining beholden to our evolutionary hardware _will_ worsen things. The other option is to pursue a sort of meta-evolution, intentionally choosing to establish a mindful relationship with pleasure and pain.

When we do this as individuals, our lives become less controlled by feeling. We also contribute to the collective shift away from reactivity. We move human momentum away from oblivion, just a bit more.

## Under no obligation

So, learn to sit with feeling, instead of habitually reacting to it. Come to understand your patterns, and shift those that do no good. There’s no need to stick to them, it’s just uncomfortable to change - but that shouldn’t stop us.

> _“You’re under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago.” -Alan Watts_

We aren’t bound by existing patterns. You can interrupt one in any moment, if you so choose. And you can become mindful of those sensations that otherwise drive your choices.

We have an innate capacity for conscious choice. Though we’re deep in our patterns, we can slow that momentum and direct it elsewhere. There’s no obligation to keep old patterns, and they don’t necessarily do any good.

And besides - chances are you don’t totally know where _you_ comes from⁷. That current self may not reflect deeper feelings of who you could be. Well, you’ve got no obligation to continue going along with your current conditioning - especially if it does no good.

This is what I’m exploring - to what extent can we change our patterns? To what extend would we _want_ to? Does who we are have any absoluteness, or is it mostly relative to experience? My guess is that it’s a bit of both - we all have natural inclinations, but also can consciously choose new patterns to live into.

_Not all our existing patterns are problematic, but many are less than ideal._ _It can do us a lot of good to self-audit, to honestly question why we act, feel, think in the ways we do._

_The next essay continues this line of thinking, exploring why we have such a hard time changing, and how we can more skillfully shift our patterns._

7: Also see if you can notice where your thoughts come from. Do you consciously decide to have a thought? Do you decide to decide? And so on. If you aren’t choosing your thoughts, but thoughts have a huge influence on what we do and feel, then… again, how did we really get here?
