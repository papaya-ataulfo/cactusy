# A framework for composing the self
## Reasoning
If we model the self as compositional, this suggests that we could create a tangible representation of a self - a composition. 

This composition would be a tool of sorts, something to use as an aid to cultivating the expressions-of-self that we actualize as. It would be a tangible object through which to pursue the creative project of cultivating and creating your-self.

It could enable precision and nuance in shaping expressions of self, like a musical composition gives precision and nuance in writing musical expressions. It would enable iteration and adjustment of our patterns and skillsets on various levels of magnification, various dimensions of detail.

This is how we can approach the self as a creative form/object - by creating a virtual representation of self that enables us to shape and reshape how we express. (Of course this also means giving the effort to grow-into/actualize the changes you craft.) 

So there's at least two things I want to distinguish here:
- Figuring out the functional mechanics of creating a composition - analogs to things like musical notation and basic structure (the "staff", key markings, notes, etc.). This would be the basic practices for creating a composition at all.
- Having a framework, a set of standards or best practices for composing well-formed expressions and cultivating a coherent self. This would be how to effectively + skillfully compose/craft a self and sub-features of a self.

There's no clear "right" way to structure or systematize compositional self, but a number of useful insights can be garnered from other creative practices.

## Possible ways to approach this in practice
This aspect of the project is its newest feature, which started to arise after a conversation with @firelogick. I've got a decent start, but admittedly this is rougher than other sections. 

So, what follows are my ideas about how to start doing this - the "functional-mechanics", and the "best-practices". Both of these are working terms for works-in-progress, and I'm excited to see where this goes. I sense that what's needed will emerge from a variety of different perspectives, analogies to other creative domains, and so on.

### Functions/Mechanics of a self-composition
**Platform/basic form:**
- The feeling is that a self-composition is not a linear thing like a musical composition. It feels more like a web of interconnected patterns, which can probably be well-delineated into domains.
	- A digression: The "path" a self takes through a day *is* linear, like a "song". Yet the expressions-of-self that an individual actualizes as throughout some day come largely from that individual's web of internalized pattern-competencies; the co-creative "song" an individual actualizes as on a given day is the particular sequence of relations between self and environment that arise on that day.
- In accordance this nonlinearity, I've been using Obsidian (a knowledge-graph program a-la Roam, Athens, etc.) to create a multidirectional, loosely hierarchical web of patterns. This is currently what my composition is, but it's fairly underdeveloped atm.

**Levels of Magnification: patterns, domains, else?**
- At present I'm representing things on these two levels of patterns and domains, where a domain is some context/space like "Productivity", "Learning", "Social Life", etc.
	- The way you actualize in-relation with that domain is the patterns that you embody/inhabit. So, patterns are the elements of a domain, and are notated/represented with a page/node in the web
	- Could delineate subdomains, areas within larger domains like "[Productivity] -> [Morning Efforts], [Weekly Reviews], [Task Organization]"; each of these also has its own internal structure of patterns, yet because this is a web a given pattern can belong to more than one domain or subdomain (fx, I might use [pomodoro workflow] in both [Morning Efforts] and [Weekly Reviews])
	- These can be backlinked in obsidian, we can also use #tags, which allow you to filter search, so that you could find and focus with greater precision
- A pattern has three dimensions to notate: thinking, feeling, acting. Each of these can be simply written out on the page; you do the crafting work elsewhere, then distill results into the composition.
- When building knowledge-graphs/webs, a lot can be gained from refactoring, basically iterating the contents of pages and their relationships for greater coherence. Feels like this would be an "upkeep" practice to develop and cohere one's self-composition 

### "Best practices" for composing a self/expressions of self
@firelogick called this "intentional character design", and that languaging resonates with me. The point of this feels like seeking well-formed, coherent expression of self. That expression is what we're looking to design, craft, cultivate, actualize.

A question to ask here might be "what's the 'grammar' for a well-formed self?" Well-formedness is a concept in linguistics referring to a coherent, meaningful linguistic expression - so we might also ask "what does a coherent, meaningful expression of self look like?"
	- Also, "what are the minimum viable/sufficient 'grammatical' structures to create a well-formed self?"
	- "What is the set of self-expressions I can actualize/take to optimize for (xyz)?"
	- Could start to derive a self in alignment with a felt-vision for your life by asking "What's the minimum viable self to flourish-in/actualize the life I wish to live?"
	
#### A framework for modeling a self/character/role
Below is what I've cohered thus far towards creating a viable way of modeling a self as something to design/create. As is generally the ethos of this project, it's aimed at being practically useful. The point is to gesture towards a way of arranging elements, structures, and dimensions of a composition so as to produce a well-formed self, when actualization of that potential is cultivated. 

Also, I harbor no illusions that this is complete/"true"., and am really looking forward to how this will develop in a collaborative space.

The model gives three layers, starting at the top and going downwards:

___
**A Meta-layer:** Metacognitive cultivation, deepened relationship with Universe/Cosmos/etc. This is all the "beyond-the-self" stuff.
___
**A Character-layer:** values+traits, styles/vibes/ways-of-being, archetypical qualities. This is about setting-out the archetypical qualities, alignments to worldly meaning/value, and stylistic ways-of-being that a given self embodies. I don't know much about creative writing but I sense it would be very useful here.
___
**A Ground-layer:** cultivating and inhabiting a core set of practices that yield basic wellbeing/embodiment of daily pattern-structures; seeking and aligning with a "path", embodying the patterns of growth and exploration that take you along that path. In other words, your grounding (life-kit, basic structures) and your direction (focus, main investment of energy).
___

**More on each layer:**

##### A Meta-layer
This is all the stuff that's "beyond-the-self", in that realm of that oh-so-difficult-to-language understanding that we are more than just the Earthly selves we usually identify as. So, this is like tending to the meta-aspects of these complex beings we are.

- Metacognitive cultivation, seeking-out and embodying a personalized ecology of practices to develop the dimensions of your metacognitive capacity. Feels related to a comment @ChristianS made on engaging with a healthy/balanced set of practices in/around PSI (phenomenological self-inquiry, B/E (I believe this was bio-energetics, somatic stuff?), Devotional practice
	- Evan also made a comment recently in response to Adam J.A.S. giving a mixing board metaphor for the access that psychdelic and/or other sufficiently deepened states can give us to play with the subtle tunings and nuances of our energies, experiences, patterns, relations. Cultivating a degree of metacognitive skillfulness as such feels to me like an essential ingredient of the ability to meaningful reshape your-self and your experience on more than just a surface level.
- Balance of focus and release states, having an optimal "grip" on life
	- Your grip on life can oscillate in an optimal range between gripping more tightly, so as to influence things, and relaxing your grip, so as to go-with things. Feels like these correspond to states of being we can consciously navigate between with our minds
	- "Focus" side of the spectrum: being able to engage with focused mind a-la flow-state, consistency and quality of attention you're able to give, etc.
		- This is where you can consciously direct your energy and take the lead in the co-creation of your experience
	- "Release" side of the spectrum: being able to engage with relaxed/released mind, presencing, holding space and holding experience lightly
		- This is where you step back and experience, allowing more space for Other to lead/contribute to co-creation
	- Both of these are necessary to live an effective human life, wherein you contribute and live in-the-world (focus), but also maintain sufficient connection to embodied, felt-sense understanding (release) that this co-creation we live as is play, is music, is art. This, such that you stay oriented as a sane, generally decent person. 
	- Misc. thought: cultivation is co-creation: sometimes you tend to the object of cultivation, sometimes you let it be and watch what happens. This gets at the idea that there's little sense in aiming to mastermind your whole self/life. That feels like it would result in overwhelming micromanaging responsbilities, whereas engaging in a continuous co-creative project-dance of cultivation feels more fruitful.
	- I think Vervaeke has said something about "optimal grip on life"

- Perhaps a core set of relations to give intentional crafting to:
	- Self, other, universe; core relations to pay attention to. Perhaps give intentional form to yours, grounding them and cultivating them over time, letting your models and corresponding pattern-embodiments grow over time
- Understanding of and relationship with meaning on a meta-level, a-la meaningness/David Chapman's stuff
	- Metaphysical stances and how those informs the lower layers


##### A Character-layer
This layer is about "designing your character" regarding how you express as a self in the world, in the domains of your life, and so on. It deals with what feel like centers-of-gravity for a self: one's values, archetypical qualities, and styles/voices/vibes that give rise to the actual patterns one embodies.

- Values (feels like your 'ethos', maybe?) 
	- Values as what meanings most resonate with you, the things you seek to embody, stand for, advance, spread. Meaning-CoGs (centers of gravity).
		- Values as your orientations/stances in relation with meaning(s)
	- Important to have a sense for what you value because that's how you orient yourself in a world of multiplicitous meanings, causes, and so on, which are presently in a lot of conflict
	- These inform the patterns you craft and cultivate, the potentials you choose to actualize.
		- fx, one who values authenticity would design and express their social patterns in accord with that value; you *live your values* by embodying them
- Character traits: the archetypical things about a self which characterize how they express in the world; the "main points" or centers-of-gravity of a personality
	- There's no guarantee these are naturally in alignment with your values, because we all inherit a lot of unuseful stuff and may very well inhabit patterns that contradict things we say that we value. So, bringing character traits into alignment with your professed values is probably important towards actualizing a more coherent self. 
- Could ask "What values and traits do I seek to align with?  What patterns of mind-body-energy would arise as the ways in which I embody those values and traits?"


- What's your style, voice, vibe? Ask this in general and per-domain of you life. You could call these "expressive-styles"
	- There are probably archetypical expressive-styles (introvert/extrovert comes to mind as one general classification), though each individual is unique and becomes more so as they cultivate and elaborate their selfhood
	- Your expressive-style as primarly made up of the major archetypical pattern-potentials that one embodies, and complexified by the minor points/nuances in your style. In other words, the web of patterns through which you express your-self in some domain and overall
		- This is something we can give intentional form to with the fluid-mode framework
	- "Style" here like "what kind of music do you bring to the world?"
	- What are the chords and melodies through which you tend to converse? Do you have multiple modes/modalities you use? What scales do you use/improvise on? What genre(s) do you prefer to play in?
		- Any experience is a co-creation, and we tend to choose to participate in those with which we most vibe - a "vibe" as the feeling you get from a style/genre of music, such that we choose to participate in the life-music that resonates with us.


- In theory, you could cultivate more than one character-role that you're capable of inhabiting; the idea of "allo-selves", maybe a core-self with allo-selves. Perhaps different roles in different domains/contexts, like "father", "friend", "brother", "Nordic LARP warrior", "sense-maker", etc. 
	- I suppose we already do this, though perhaps without craft-intentionality; selves/characters we can inhabit could be designed and learned/cultivated as systems of patterns 
	- ("allo-" from allomorphs, allophones, meaning "contextual variants of (xyz)")

- Another consideration: Give-and-take - What does this self give, what does it ask? How does it fit into the greater context and what sort of reality-paradigm is it contributing its energy to the actualization of? 
- Misc. thought: not really sure where this registers on the "quality-woo<--->not-quality-woo" spectrum, but astrology might give a decent look at the archetypical traits/ways of being you may embody. This could give a good jumpstart to the effort to model and shape your-self.


##### A Ground-layer
This layer is about the specific actualizations/embodiments of pattern that you arise as, the level at which we seek out and bring to life the structures and systems of patterns that we are overall and in specific domains. The point here would be to lay-out/arrange the patterns you create in a way that support/nourish/actualize the life you'd like to live, the self you feel drawn towards becoming,

- Having "ground-layer basics", the minimum viable arrangement of habits that supports sufficient wellbeing to further grow your-self
	- What basic inputs do you need to nourish/support minimum viable wellbeing? What about those for a more optimal state of wellbeing?  (sufficient vs. optimal nutrition, exercise, etc.)
	- Daily structures (basic wellbeing, etc.): what's the basic arrangement of patterns that keep you sufficiently energized, awake/alert, consistent, healthy enough to grow further? Things like a decent diet, daily movement/physical exertion, healthy sleeping patterns, healthy relationship with media consumption, a minimum of healthy social relation, a bit of fun/play. There's probably more to consider and it probably varies for each individual, especially in the particulars of the practices chosen. 
	- Point here is to actualize a set of positive feedback loops which stabilize you in a state of "healthy enough" such that you can further pursue cultivation/shaping of your-self in more effortful ways that may not be accessible at an earlier stage of your growth (fx, you'll generally want to be eating and sleeping decently before you attempt a yoga practice, yet these are not wholly consistent things for plenty of folks)

- Coming into alignment with your "path", following inner felt-sense to explore and actualize the ecology of practices that's right for you and which nourishes mind, body, energy, spirit. This feels related to being/becoming a live player.
	- A feeling I've had is that a self needs a "focus", a commitment to some direction. This feels related to individuals pursuing projects in alignment with what resonates wth them, as well as pursuing your own practice-paths like yoga, meditation, etc. 
	- One needs to invest a meaningful amount of energy into some-thing(s) such to become a distinct person, as characterized by the commitments that person embodies. The practice of picking a direction and weathering the path/following through, orienting and reorienting, pivoting, overcoming obstacles, etc. deepens and elaborates a person
	- Learning to navigate and stay committed to a path spurs a self/character to develop momentum and purposefulness, aliveness, meaningfully deep relationship with their chosen lived-experience(s). You can't achieve much depth if you don't commit to a direction and follow-through; depth feels related to maturation.
	- "You can let life make you, or you can participate in the co-creation." - a lot people just end up accepting themselves as they were conditioned to be by prior experience, which is unfortunate. We don't need to do this.
	- Some sort of ignition or passion to catalyze this; tending to your inner-fire
	- In analogy to gaming, this feels relating to your "character-class"
	- This feels related to a person's specializations, a-la domains of skill they've cultivated to a higher than average level, such that they can perform/navigate with a degree of fluency/fluidity in that domain
		- Cultivating a meaningful degree of skill is a valuable dimension/feature of the human experience 
- Coming into alignment with your path, and keeping that orientation, hinges on developing your felt-sense. Use that to seek and grow into the patterns/practices that resonate with you. These also may shift and develop over time (fx, I've gone through ~4-5 morning routines, currently settled on one that feels right for now)


- States and state-rhythm: feels like it's possible to design your self/patterns with attention paid to the rhythm/patterning of states you flow through on a daily basis, in domains, etc.
	- A state as the compound experience of a felt-energy and thought-space and behavioral-option-space that follow from that feeling. Made up of mind-body-energy.
	- Designing your daily life in terms of your rhythm of states, aligning them to support the things you'd like to achieve/experience/embody/inhabit each day
		- What's your main rhythm/tempo? Also, any chunk of pattern has a rhythm and tempo, and those are the rhythmic units of your overall flow
		- What are the behavioral option-spaces that open to you in-accordance with the regular felt-states you experience? You'll have different ease of access to certain behaviors depending on the felt-state you're in. Given that we can influence the felt-states we experience by cultivating our patterns to produce/be-as those states we'd like to have, we can also influence the behavioral spaces available to us throughout the day.
			- This feels foggy but heading in the right direction
	- How do you navigate your states/modes, and maintain balance? An interface of some sort?
	- Similar things said with ~more words~:
		- Primary/secondary orientations/model-stances (what are the main thought-spaces you live through?); these would correspond to your states, which are compound of mind-state, felt-state, behavioral-space. What are the primary vivifications of mind, energy, and body that you live through?
