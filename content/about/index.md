Hey, hope you're well.

I'm really not sure how to right these page. I'm not really sure how to be myself online, so I'm just writing and we'll see what comes of it.

So this site, living fluently... it's meant to host this project I've been working on for the past two years, a project which started as an effort to create a new way of approaching habits. That then morphed fairly broadly into an effort to answer the question "How can we more skillfully live, grow, and navigate reality?", and from that has expanded this whole complex set of skills and practices...

Yet honestly, that above doesn't matter that much. It's a big ol' mess that I'm doing my best to sort out and gradually communicate. So it's in part the focus of this website, but... I also just want to write. I just want to write, to share what I'm learning, experiencing, and growing through in an effort to co-sensemake, mostly around what's commonly called "self-improvement", habits, and whatnot.

It's my intuition that there's a ton of potential to transform the narrative, the practices, the whole way we as a culture view and approach self-directed growth. My own thinking is in part influenced by the optimization-focused, biohack-y culture, but more recently engulfed lovingly by metamodern culture, especially what's going on around the Stoa.

In writing and giving, I want to do everything I can to contribute to creating new understanding and helping to shift us towards new, healthier relationship with habits, with our growth, and so on...

And shit, there's a lot more. I can't cram it all into one little about page. Just read the blog, ya raggamuffin ~
