"A place for me to gradually write this project into reality"

I'm feeling like I want to cut down this story, condense it and focus on the journey to create this new method. I can link to a larger story.

How to cut it down? Do a succinctness for the whole thing.

## About me














## This is not quite a blog
This website is like... it's like a blog, except not quite. I've been working on this project for around two years without really coherently producing much writing or tangible artifacts, so I've got this giant messy tangle of ideas and thoughts and models in my head that I'm having a hard time communicating. This website is in part to home all of the writing I am now doing to realize this project in a clearer, more stable, more tangible form. I work in obsidian, a networked-notes tool, so it's all very interconnected. I'm hoping this website will allow me to achieve a sort of wiki-style structure of interwoven posts.

So the actual content is like, in part me producing writing about the various aspects of this project, all the models I've got, in an evergreen-notes sort of way, and in part me doing weekly on-the-fly public journaling to share where I actively am in my journey to make sense of my life, create something of it and myself.
