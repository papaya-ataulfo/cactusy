# Hey, welcome ~ ü§≤üçµ
*This site's totally a work-in-progress*

I'm developing a set of practices with which to shape the self as a creative form. This is my effort to realize an alternative approach to traditional self-improvement - reimagining it to draw forth a fuller, more authentic, more beautiful way of doing personal growth.

[Go here](#good-places-to-start) for a bunch of links. Otherwise, read on for a bit more intro to this project.

How do we show up in the world? Through what patterns do we live, express, and continually become? We're made of patterns, in ways simple and complex, and these patterns can be treated as the elements of a compositional self. If we zoom in one more level, these patterns can also be treated as compositions - enabling us to design, iterate, and shape them. 

By shaping our patterns, we're giving intentional form to our habitual ways of being. Doing this with a mindset oriented to creativity means that we'll naturally grow towards resonant alignment. One pattern at a time, these individual elements build up to the larger self-composition.

The more skillfully, and the more artfully, we can shape ourselves, the better we can align with authentic, meaningful expression of the lives we seek to live.

This is what I'm working on - exploring and articulating the theory and practice of such a skillset as would enable us to approach self-creation as craft, as art, as a tangible creative practice. 

## It's in-motion!

I've been engaged in this project for the past two years, and there's no "end" in sight. I've made meaningful progress, mainly on a fresh approach to habits, yet there's a ton more to explore and figure out.

It's well-time to share what I've found, and that's the purpose of this website. I'm here to gradually write the project so far into reality, and to see what comes of opening it up to co-discovery.

There's incredible potential to be found in recreating the way we go about self-directed growth, creation of our-selves and our lives. Traditional self-improvement is a good place to start, but there is plenty of room for a more creative, more beautiful alternative.

# Good places to start
This project has gotten pretty complex, so it's been a challenge to start communicating it. There's multiple facets to the core of it, and mutltiple points of entry. These three below sort of triangulate what I'm trying to say -
- [The self can be approached as a creative form](../posts/selfasacreativeform)
- [Growth can be approached as a creative practice](../posts/growthcanbeapproachedasacreativepractice)
- [Living can be approached as a skill](../posts/livingcanbeapproachedasaskill)

Also feel free to start from these main aspects of the project - 

- [An intro-overview of patternshaping](../posts/anintrooverviewofpatternshaping)
- [A fluid-mode framework for growing complex skills](../posts/fluencycultivationlocus)
- [How could we compose a self?](../posts/howcouldwecomposeaself)

And here's some essays I've written (and am refactoring) -
- [Living is dialogue with reality](../posts/livingisdialoguewithreality) (this is where *living fluently* comes from)
- [How did we really get here?](../posts/howdidwereallygethere) 
- [Patterns are an intrinsic feature of reality](../posts/patternsareanintrinsicfeatureofreality)

## Thanks for stopping by üôÇ
I'm going for something like [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) with this site. I work in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), so my goal is to gradually build this site as a fluid, interconnected web of ideas, in the spirit of networked knowledge cultivation.

A lot of it is already connected in my mind, but I haven't created clear, stable articulations of many of the various concepts, terms, propositions, and arguments. So there's gonna be a bunch of pages that aren't written yet; I'm putting them in place to let structure organically arise as I go, and I'll be gradually writing them.

It's a work-in-progress!
