I've been drawn for a long while to figure out how to live as skillfully as I can manage - it's a crazy world we're living in, and I figure the more effectively I can navigate and respond to it, the more I can contribute to creating a better world, whatever that may mean. Below it looks like I haven't written anything since February, but that's inaccurate - this site's a work in progress as I migrate a lot of my thinking here from my local Obsidian vault."
